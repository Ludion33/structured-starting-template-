# Structured-starting-template

You'll find my starting template whenever i start a project from scratch, or whenever i need to try a feature very fast. 

This structure is very simple to use. 

1. Dowload all the files to your computer

2. Open them the folder with your favorit text editor (Sublim Text, Visual Studio Code, Atom, ...)

3. As i'm using Sass (https://sass-lang.com/install) to help me write faster css, you'll need to compile it to css. 

To do that, you'll need either to watch for changes and make it compile on changes (https://sass-lang.com/guide) or use a third party program. 

For the beginner, i'd advise to take a look at KOALA (http://koala-app.com/), super easy to use : 
  - install it
  - open it 
  - drag and drop the sass folder from your project
  - clic compile
  - tadaaa
  
Hope this is usefull, have a nice day !
